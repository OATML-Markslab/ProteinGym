            ABSTRACT
            Functional constraints on viral proteins are often assessed by examining sequence conservation among natural strains, but this approach is relatively ineffective for Zika virus because all known sequences are highly similar. Here, we take an alternative approach to map functional constraints on Zika virus’s envelope (E) protein by using deep mutational scanning to measure how all amino acid mutations to the E protein affect viral growth in cell culture. The resulting sequence-function map is consistent with existing knowledge about E protein structure and function but also provides insight into mutation-level constraints in many regions of the protein that have not been well characterized in prior functional work. In addition, we extend our approach to completely map how mutations affect viral neutralization by two monoclonal antibodies, thereby precisely defining their functional epitopes. Overall, our study provides a valuable resource for understanding the effects of mutations to this important viral protein and also offers a roadmap for future work to map functional and antigenic selection to Zika virus at high resolution.
            
              IMPORTANCE
              Zika virus has recently been shown to be associated with severe birth defects. The virus’s E protein mediates its ability to infect cells and is also the primary target of the antibodies that are elicited by natural infection and vaccines that are being developed against the virus. Therefore, determining the effects of mutations to this protein is important for understanding its function, its susceptibility to vaccine-mediated immunity, and its potential for future evolution. We completely mapped how amino acid mutations to the E protein affected the virus’s ability to grow in cells in the laboratory and escape from several antibodies. The resulting maps relate changes in the E protein’s sequence to changes in viral function and therefore provide a valuable complement to existing maps of the physical structure of the protein.},

VKOR is also the target of the widely used anticoagulant drug, warfarin. Despite VKOR’s pivotal role in coagulation, its structure and active site remain poorly understood. In addition, VKOR variants can cause vitamin K-dependent clotting factor deficiency or alter warfarin response. Here, we used multiplexed, sequencing-based assays to measure the effects of 2,695 VKOR missense variants on abundance and 697 variants on activity in cultured human cells. The large-scale functional data, along with an evolutionary coupling analysis, supports a four transmembrane domain topology, with variants in transmembrane domains exhibiting strongly deleterious effects on abundance and activity. Functionally constrained regions of the protein define the active site, and we find that, of four conserved cysteines putatively critical for function, only three are absolutely required. Finally, 25\% of human VKOR missense variants show reduced abundance or activity, possibly conferring warfarin sensitivity or causing disease.},

            Ubiquitin is a 76 residue protein that is attached to target proteins as a posttranslational modification. This modification is dependent on the successive activity of three enzymes, designated E1, E2, and E3. We developed a high-throughput mutagenesis strategy to probe the mechanism of E3-catalyzed transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to the target protein. By scoring the effect of nearly 100,000 mutations in an E3, we identified mutations that affect direct and allosteric interactions between the E3 and the E2. These results highlight the general utility of high-throughput mutagenesis in delineating the molecular basis of enzyme activity.
          , 
            Although ubiquitination plays a critical role in virtually all cellular processes, mechanistic details of ubiquitin (Ub) transfer are still being defined. To identify the molecular determinants within E3 ligases that modulate activity, we scored each member of a library of nearly 100,000 protein variants of the murine ubiquitination factor E4B (Ube4b) U-box domain for auto-ubiquitination activity in the presence of the E2 UbcH5c. This assay identified mutations that enhance activity both in vitro and in cellular p53 degradation assays. The activity-enhancing mutations fall into two distinct mechanistic classes: One increases the U-box:E2-binding affinity, and the other allosterically stimulates the formation of catalytically active conformations of the E2∼Ub conjugate. The same mutations enhance E3 activity in the presence of another E2, Ube2w, implying a common allosteric mechanism, and therefore the general applicability of our observations to other E3s. A comparison of the E3 activity with the two different E2s identified an additional variant that exhibits E3:E2 specificity. Our results highlight the general utility of high-throughput mutagenesis in delineating the molecular basis of enzyme activity.},

Traditional approaches to study these properties have typically required the direct measurement of the property of interest, oftentimes a laborious undertaking. Although protein properties can be probed by mutagenesis, this approach has been limited by its low throughput. Recent technological developments have enabled the rapid quantification of a protein’s function, such as binding to a ligand, for numerous variants of that protein. Here, we measure the ability of 47,000 variants of a WW domain to bind to a peptide ligand and use these functional measurements to identify stabilizing mutations without directly assaying stability. Our approach is rooted in the well-established concept that protein function is closely related to stability. Protein function is generally reduced by destabilizing mutations, but this decrease can be rescued by stabilizing mutations. Based on this observation, we introduce partner potentiation, a metric that uses this rescue ability to identify stabilizing mutations, and identify 15 candidate stabilizing mutations in the WW domain. We tested six candidates by thermal denaturation and found two highly stabilizing mutations, one more stabilizing than any previously known mutation. Thus, physicochemical properties such as stability are latent within these large-scale protein functional data and can be revealed by systematic analysis. This approach should allow other protein properties to be discovered.},

            The serotonin transporter, SERT, catalyzes serotonin reuptake at the synapse to terminate neurotransmission via an alternating access mechanism, and SERT inhibitors are the most widely prescribed antidepressants. Here, deep mutagenesis is used to determine the effects of nearly all amino acid substitutions on human SERT surface expression and transport of the fluorescent substrate analogue APP+, identifying many mutations that enhance APP+ import. Comprehensive simulations of the entire ion-coupled import process reveal that while binding of the native substrate, serotonin, reduces free energy barriers between conformational states to promote SERT dynamics, the conformational free energy landscape in the presence of APP+ instead resembles Na
            +
            bound-SERT, with a higher free energy barrier for transitioning to an inward-facing state. The deep mutational scan for SERT-catalyzed import of APP+ finds mutations that promote the necessary conformational changes that would otherwise be facilitated by the native substrate. Indeed, hundreds of gain-of-function mutations for APP+ import are found along the permeation pathway, most notably mutations that favor opening of a solvent-exposed intracellular vestibule. The mutagenesis data support the simulated mechanism in which the neurotransmitter and a symported sodium share a common cytosolic exit pathway to achieve coupling. Furthermore, the mutational landscape for SERT surface trafficking, which likely filters out misfolded sequences, reveals that residues along the permeation pathway are mutationally tolerant, providing plausible evolutionary pathways for changes in transporter properties while maintaining folded structure.},

	abstract = {The RNA recognition motif (RRM) is the most common RNA-binding domain in eukaryotes. Differences in RRM sequences dictate, in part, both RNA and protein-binding specificities and affinities. We used a deep mutational scanning approach to study the sequence-function relationship of the RRM2 domain of the
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae
              poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1). By scoring the activity of more than 100,000 unique Pab1 variants, including 1246 with single amino acid substitutions, we delineated the mutational constraints on each residue. Clustering of residues with similar mutational patterns reveals three major classes, composed principally of RNA-binding residues, of hydrophobic core residues, and of the remaining residues. The first class also includes a highly conserved residue not involved in RNA binding, G150, which can be mutated to destabilize Pab1. A comparison of the mutational sensitivity of yeast Pab1 residues to their evolutionary conservation reveals that most residues tolerate more substitutions than are present in the natural sequences, although other residues that tolerate fewer substitutions may point to specialized functions in yeast. An analysis of ∼40,000 double mutants indicates a preference for a short distance between two mutations that display an epistatic interaction. As examples of interactions, the mutations N139T, N139S, and I157L suppress other mutations that interfere with RNA binding and protein stability. Overall, this study demonstrates that living cells can be subjected to a single assay to analyze hundreds of thousands of protein variants in parallel.},

	abstract = {Ubiquitin is essential for eukaryotic life and varies in only 3 amino acid positions between yeast and humans. However, recent deep sequencing studies indicate that ubiquitin is highly tolerant to single mutations. We hypothesized that this tolerance would be reduced by chemically induced physiologic perturbations. To test this hypothesis, a class of first year UCSF graduate students employed deep mutational scanning to determine the fitness landscape of all possible single residue mutations in the presence of five different small molecule perturbations. These perturbations uncover 'shared sensitized positions' localized to areas around the hydrophobic patch and the C-terminus. In addition, we identified perturbation specific effects such as a sensitization of His68 in HU and a tolerance to mutation at Lys63 in DTT. Our data show how chemical stresses can reduce buffering effects in the ubiquitin proteasome system. Finally, this study demonstrates the potential of lab-based interdisciplinary graduate curriculum.
          , 
            The ability of an organism to grow and reproduce, that is, it’s “fitness”, is determined by how its genes interact with the environment. Yeast is a model organism in which researchers can control the exact mutations present in the yeast’s genes (its genotype) and the conditions in which the yeast cells live (their environment). This allows researchers to measure how a yeast cell’s genotype and environment affect its fitness.
            Ubiquitin is a protein that many organisms depend on to manage cell stress by acting as a tag that targets other proteins for degradation. Essential proteins such as ubiquitin often remain unchanged by mutation over long periods of time. As a result, these proteins evolve very slowly. Like all proteins, ubiquitin is built from a chain of amino acid molecules linked together, and the ubiquitin proteins of yeast and humans are made of almost identical sequences of amino acids.
            Although ubiquitin has barely changed its sequence over evolution, previous studies have shown that – under normal growth conditions in the laboratory – most amino acids in ubiquitin can be mutated without any loss of cell fitness. This led Mavor et al. to hypothesize that treating the yeast cells with chemicals that cause cell stress might lead to amino acids in ubiquitin becoming more sensitive to mutation.
            To test this idea, a class of graduate students at the University of California, San Francisco grew yeast cells with different ubiquitin mutations together, and with different chemicals that induce cell stress, and measured their growth rates. Sequencing the ubiquitin gene in the thousands of tested yeast cells revealed that three of the chemicals cause a shared set of amino acids in ubiquitin to become more sensitive to mutation.
            This result suggests that these amino acids are important for the stress response, possibly by altering the ability of yeast cells to target certain proteins for degradation. Conversely, another chemical causes yeast to become more tolerant to changes in the ubiquitin sequence. The experiments also link changes in particular amino acids in ubiquitin to specific stress responses.
            Mavor et al. show that many of ubquitin’s amino acids are sensitive to mutation under different stress conditions, while others can be mutated to form different amino acids without effecting fitness. By testing the effects of other chemicals, future experiments could further characterize how the yeast’s genotype and environment interact.},

	abstract = {Background:
              Variants in ion channel genes have classically been studied in low throughput by patch clamping. Deep mutational scanning is a complementary approach that can simultaneously assess function of thousands of variants.
            
            
              Methods:
              
                We have developed and validated a method to perform a deep mutational scan of variants in
                SCN5A
                , which encodes the major voltage-gated sodium channel in the heart. We created a library of nearly all possible variants in a 36 base region of
                SCN5A
                in the S4 voltage sensor of domain IV and stably integrated the library into HEK293T cells.
              
            
            
              Results:
              In preliminary experiments, challenge with 3 drugs (veratridine, brevetoxin, and ouabain) could discriminate wild-type channels from gain- and loss-of-function pathogenic variants. High-throughput sequencing of the pre- and postdrug challenge pools was used to count the prevalence of each variant and identify variants with abnormal function. The deep mutational scan scores identified 40 putative gain-of-function and 33 putative loss-of-function variants. For 8 of 9 variants, patch clamping data were consistent with the scores.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              
                These experiments demonstrate the accuracy of a high-throughput in vitro scan of
                SCN5A

            Insoluble protein aggregates are the hallmarks of many neurodegenerative diseases. For example, aggregates of TDP-43 occur in nearly all cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, whether aggregates cause cellular toxicity is still not clear, even in simpler cellular systems. We reasoned that deep mutagenesis might be a powerful approach to disentangle the relationship between aggregation and toxicity. We generated {\textgreater}50,000 mutations in the prion-like domain (PRD) of TDP-43 and quantified their toxicity in yeast cells. Surprisingly, mutations that increase hydrophobicity and aggregation strongly decrease toxicity. In contrast, toxic variants promote the formation of dynamic liquid-like condensates. Mutations have their strongest effects in a hotspot that genetic interactions reveal to be structured in vivo, illustrating how mutagenesis can probe the in vivo structures of unstructured proteins. Our results show that aggregation of TDP-43 is not harmful but protects cells, most likely by titrating the protein away from a toxic liquid-like phase.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            With the continual evolution of new strains of SARS-CoV-2 that are more virulent, transmissible, and able to evade current vaccines, there is an urgent need for effective anti-viral drugs. SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M
            pro
            ) is a leading target for drug design due to its conserved and indispensable role in the viral life cycle. Drugs targeting M
            pro
            appear promising but will elicit selection pressure for resistance. To understand resistance potential in M
            pro
            , we performed a comprehensive mutational scan of the protease that analyzed the function of all possible single amino acid changes. We developed three separate high-throughput assays of M
            pro
            function in yeast, based on either the ability of M
            pro
            variants to cleave at a defined cut-site or on the toxicity of their expression to yeast. We used deep sequencing to quantify the functional effects of each variant in each screen. The protein fitness landscapes from all three screens were strongly correlated, indicating that they captured the biophysical properties critical to M
            pro
            function. The fitness landscapes revealed a non-active site location on the surface that is extremely sensitive to mutation making it a favorable location to target with inhibitors. In addition, we found a network of critical amino acids that physically bridge the two active sites of the M
            pro
            dimer. The clinical variants of M
            pro
            were predominantly functional in our screens, indicating that M
            pro
            is under strong selection pressure in the human population. Our results provide predictions of mutations that will be readily accessible to M
            pro
            evolution and that are likely to contribute to drug resistance. This complete mutational guide of M
            pro
            can be used in the design of inhibitors with reduced potential of evolving viral resistance.},

	abstract = {The immediate evolutionary space accessible to HIV is largely determined by how single amino acid mutations affect fitness. These mutational effects can shift as the virus evolves. However, the prevalence of such shifts in mutational effects remains unclear. Here, we quantify the effects on viral growth of all amino acid mutations to two HIV envelope (Env) proteins that differ at
              
                {\textgreater}
              
              100 residues. Most mutations similarly affect both Envs, but the amino acid preferences of a minority of sites have clearly shifted. These shifted sites usually prefer a specific amino acid in one Env, but tolerate many amino acids in the other. Surprisingly, shifts are only slightly enriched at sites that have substituted between the Envs—and many occur at residues that do not even contact substitutions. Therefore, long-range epistasis can unpredictably shift Env’s mutational tolerance during HIV evolution, although the amino acid preferences of most sites are conserved between moderately diverged viral strains.
            
          , 
            The virus that causes AIDS, or HIV, has a protein called Env on its surface, which is essential for the virus to infect cells. Env can also be recognized by the immune system, which then targets the virus for destruction or blocks it from infecting cells. Unfortunately, Env evolves very quickly, which means that HIV can evade our defenses. However, there are limits to how much this protein can change, since it still needs to perform its essential role in helping viruses enter cells.
            In the century since HIV first appeared in human populations, the virus has evolved considerably. There are now many HIV strains that infect people, and they bear Env proteins with substantially different sequences. However, it is not clear if these changes in sequence have resulted in Envs from distinct strains being able to tolerate different mutations.
            To examine this question, Haddox et al. compared how the Envs from two strains of HIV react to modifications in their sequences. They created all possible individual mutations in the proteins, and the resulting collections of mutated viruses were then tested for their ability to infect cells in the laboratory.
            Most mutations had similar effects in both Env proteins. This allowed Haddox et al. to identify portions of the protein that easily accommodate changes, and portions that must remain unchanged for viruses to remain infectious—at least in the laboratory. Some of these mutations are under different types of pressures when the virus faces the immune system, and those were identified using computational approaches.
            However, some mutations were tolerated differently by the two Env proteins. Therefore, viral strains differ in how their Env proteins can evolve. The parts of Env that showed differences in mutational tolerance between the strains were not necessarily the parts that differ in sequence. This shows that changes in sequence in one part of the protein can modify how other portions evolve.
            It remains to be determined whether changes in tolerance to mutations translate into differences in how the virus can escape immunity. This is an important question given that the rapid evolution of Env is a major obstacle to creating a vaccine for HIV.},

            A key goal in the study of influenza virus evolution is to forecast which viral strains will persist and which ones will die out. Here we experimentally measure the effects of all amino acid mutations to the hemagglutinin protein from a human H3N2 influenza strain on viral growth in cell culture. We show that these measurements have utility for distinguishing among viral strains that do and do not succeed in nature. Overall, our work suggests that new high-throughput experimental approaches may be useful for understanding virus evolution in nature.
          , 
            Human influenza virus rapidly accumulates mutations in its major surface protein hemagglutinin (HA). The evolutionary success of influenza virus lineages depends on how these mutations affect HA’s functionality and antigenicity. Here we experimentally measure the effects on viral growth in cell culture of all single amino acid mutations to the HA from a recent human H3N2 influenza virus strain. We show that mutations that are measured to be more favorable for viral growth are enriched in evolutionarily successful H3N2 viral lineages relative to mutations that are measured to be less favorable for viral growth. Therefore, despite the well-known caveats about cell-culture measurements of viral fitness, such measurements can still be informative for understanding evolution in nature. We also compare our measurements for H3 HA to similar data previously generated for a distantly related H1 HA and find substantial differences in which amino acids are preferred at many sites. For instance, the H3 HA has less disparity in mutational tolerance between the head and stalk domains than the H1 HA. Overall, our work suggests that experimental measurements of mutational effects can be leveraged to help understand the evolutionary fates of viral lineages in nature—but only when the measurements are made on a viral strain similar to the ones being studied in nature.},

The distribution of mutant fitness effect and the forces shaping this distribution are therefore keys to predict the evolutionary fate of organisms and their constituents such as enzymes. Here, by producing and sequencing a comprehensive collection of 10,000 mutants, we explore the mutational landscape of one enzyme involved in the spread of antibiotic resistance, the beta-lactamase TEM-1. We measured mutation impact on the enzyme activity through the estimation of amoxicillin minimum inhibitory concentration on a subset of 990 mutants carrying a unique missense mutation, representing 64\% of possible amino acid changes in that protein reachable by point mutation. We established that mutation type, solvent accessibility of residues, and the predicted effect of mutations on protein stability primarily determined alone or in combination changes in minimum inhibitory concentration of mutants. Moreover, we were able to capture the drastic modification of the mutational landscape induced by a single stabilizing point mutation (M182T) by a simple model of protein stability. This work thereby provides an integrated framework to study mutation effects and a tool to understand/define better the epistatic interactions.},

	abstract = {Summary
          Adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids have shown clinical promise as delivery vectors for gene therapy. However, the high prevalence of pre-existing immunity against natural capsids poses a challenge for widespread treatment. The generation of diverse capsids that are potentially more capable of immune evasion is challenging because introducing multiple mutations often breaks capsid assembly. Here we target a representative, immunologically relevant 28-amino-acid segment of the AAV2 capsid and show that a low-complexity Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) can interpolate in sequence space to produce diverse and novel capsids capable of packaging their own genomes. We first train the VAE on a 564-sample Multiple-Sequence Alignment (MSA) of dependo-parvoviruses, and then further augment this dataset by adding 22,704 samples from a deep mutational exploration (DME) on the target region. In both cases the VAE generated viable variants with many mutations, which we validated experimentally. We propose that this simple approach can be used to optimize and diversify other proteins, as well as other capsid traits of interest for gene delivery.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              PTEN is a multi-functional tumor suppressor protein regulating cell growth, immune signaling, neuronal function, and genome stability. Experimental characterization can help guide the clinical interpretation of the thousands of germline or somatic PTEN variants observed in patients. Two large-scale mutational datasets, one for PTEN variant intracellular abundance encompassing 4112 missense variants and one for lipid phosphatase activity encompassing 7244 variants, were recently published. The combined information from these datasets can reveal variant-specific phenotypes that may underlie various clinical presentations, but this has not been comprehensively examined, particularly for somatic PTEN variants observed in cancers.
            
            
              Methods
              Here, we add to these efforts by measuring the intracellular abundance of 764 new PTEN variants and refining abundance measurements for 3351 previously studied variants. We use this expanded and refined PTEN abundance dataset to explore the mutational patterns governing PTEN intracellular abundance, and then incorporate the phosphatase activity data to subdivide PTEN variants into four functionally distinct groups.
            
            
              Results
              This analysis revealed a set of highly abundant but lipid phosphatase defective variants that could act in a dominant-negative fashion to suppress PTEN activity. Two of these variants were, indeed, capable of dysregulating Akt signaling in cells harboring a WT PTEN allele. Both variants were observed in multiple breast or uterine tumors, demonstrating the disease relevance of these high abundance, inactive variants.
            
            
              Conclusions
              We show that multidimensional, large-scale variant functional data, when paired with public cancer genomics datasets and follow-up assays, can improve understanding of uncharacterized cancer-associated variants, and provide better insights into how they contribute to oncogenesis.},

	abstract = {The {\textgreater}800 human G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are responsible for transducing diverse chemical stimuli to alter cell state- and are the largest class of drug targets. Their myriad structural conformations and various modes of signaling make it challenging to understand their structure and function. Here, we developed a platform to characterize large libraries of GPCR variants in human cell lines with a barcoded transcriptional reporter of G protein signal transduction. We tested 7800 of 7828 possible single amino acid substitutions to the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (Beta

              AR signaling, mutations in the human population that are potentially loss of function, and residues that modulate basal activity. Using unsupervised learning, we identify residues critical for signaling, including all major structural motifs and molecular interfaces. We also find a previously uncharacterized structural latch spanning the first two extracellular loops that is highly conserved across Class A GPCRs and is conformationally rigid in both the inactive and active states of the receptor. More broadly, by linking deep mutational scanning with engineered transcriptional reporters, we establish a generalizable method for exploring pharmacogenomics, structure and function across broad classes of drug receptors.},

Despite many biochemical studies in diverse MBLs, molecular understanding of the roles of residues in the enzyme’s stability and function, and especially substrate specificity, is lacking. Here, we employ deep mutational scanning (DMS) to generate comprehensive single amino acid variant data on a major clinical MBL, VIM-2, by measuring the effect of thousands of VIM-2 mutants on the degradation of three representative classes of Beta-lactams (ampicillin, cefotaxime, and meropenem) and at two different temperatures (25°C and 37°C). We revealed residues responsible for expression and translocation, and mutations that increase resistance and/or alter substrate specificity. The distribution of specificity-altering mutations unveiled distinct molecular recognition of the three substrates. Moreover, these function-altering mutations are frequently observed among naturally occurring variants, suggesting that the enzymes have continuously evolved to become more potent resistance genes.},

	abstract = {Viruses like influenza are infamous for their ability to adapt to new hosts. Retrospective studies of natural zoonoses and passaging in the lab have identified a modest number of host-adaptive mutations. However, it is unclear if these mutations represent all ways that influenza can adapt to a new host. Here we take a prospective approach to this question by completely mapping amino-acid mutations to the avian influenza virus polymerase protein PB2 that enhance growth in human cells. We identify numerous previously uncharacterized human-adaptive mutations. These mutations cluster on PB2’s surface, highlighting potential interfaces with host factors. Some previously uncharacterized adaptive mutations occur in avian-to-human transmission of H7N9 influenza, showing their importance for natural virus evolution. But other adaptive mutations do not occur in nature because they are inaccessible via single-nucleotide mutations. Overall, our work shows how selection at key molecular surfaces combines with evolutionary accessibility to shape viral host adaptation.
          , 
            Viruses copy themselves by hijacking the cells of an infected host, but this comes with some limitations. Cells from different species have different molecular machinery and so viruses often have to specialize to a narrow group of species. This specialization consists largely of fine-tuning the way that viral proteins interact with host proteins.
            For instance, in bird flu viruses, a protein known as PB2 does not interact well with the machinery in human cells. Because PB2 proteins form part of the viral polymerase (the structure that copies the viral genome), this prevents bird flu viruses from replicating efficiently in humans. Sometimes however, changes in the PB2 protein allow bird flu viruses to better replicate in humans, potentially leading to deadly flu pandemics.
            To understand exactly how this happens, researchers have previously used two approaches: examining the changes that have happened in past flu viruses, and monitoring the evolution of bird flu viruses grown in human cells in the lab. However, these approaches can only look at a small number of the many possible genetic changes to the virus. This makes it hard to anticipate the new ways that flu might adapt to human cells in the future.
            To overcome this problem, Soh et al. systematically created all of the single changes to the bird flu PB2, altering every element of the protein sequence one-by-one. They then tested which of the changes to PB2 helped the virus grow better in human cells. The modifications that made the viruses thrive were on the surface of the protein, suggesting that they might improve interaction with the cell machinery of the host. Some changes have been found in bird flu viruses that have recently jumped into humans in nature, although fortunately none of these viruses have yet spread widely to cause a pandemic.
            Many factors affect the evolution of viruses, and their ability to infect new species. Understanding which changes in proteins help these microbes adapt to new hosts is an important element that scientists could consider to assess future risks of pandemics.},

	abstract = {Plaques of the amyloid beta (Aß) peptide are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. Mutations in Aß also cause familial forms of AD (fAD). Here, we use deep mutational scanning to quantify the effects of {\textgreater}14,000 mutations on the aggregation of Aß. The resulting genetic landscape reveals mechanistic insights into fibril nucleation, including the importance of charge and gatekeeper residues in the disordered region outside of the amyloid core in preventing nucleation. Strikingly, unlike computational predictors and previous measurements, the empirical nucleation scores accurately identify all known dominant fAD mutations in Aß, genetically validating that the mechanism of nucleation in a cell-based assay is likely to be very similar to the mechanism that causes the human disease. These results provide the first comprehensive atlas of how mutations alter the formation of any amyloid fibril and a resource for the interpretation of genetic variation in Aß.
          , 
            Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia, affecting more than 50 million people worldwide. Despite more than 400 clinical trials, there are still no effective drugs that can prevent or treat the disease. A common target in Alzheimer’s disease trials is a small protein called amyloid beta. Amyloid beta proteins are ‘sticky’ molecules. In the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease, they join to form first small aggregates and then long chains called fibrils, a process which is toxic to neurons.
            Specific mutations in the gene for amyloid beta are known to cause rare, aggressive forms of Alzheimer’s disease that typically affect people in their fifties or sixties. But these are not the only mutations that can occur in amyloid beta. In principle, any part of the protein could undergo mutation. And given the size of the human population, it is likely that each of these mutations exists in someone alive today.
            Seuma et al. reasoned that studying these mutations could help us understand the process by which amyloid beta forms new aggregates. Using an approach called deep mutational scanning, Seuma et al. mutated each point in the protein, one at a time. This produced more than 14,000 different versions of amyloid beta. Seuma et al. then measured how quickly these mutants were able to form aggregates by introducing them into yeast cells.
            All the mutations known to cause early-onset Alzheimer’s disease accelerated amyloid beta aggregation in the yeast. But the results also revealed previously unknown properties that control how fast aggregation occurs. In addition, they highlighted a number of positions in the amyloid beta sequence that act as ‘gatekeepers’. In healthy brains, these gatekeepers prevent amyloid beta proteins from sticking together. When mutated, they drive the protein to form aggregates.
            This comprehensive dataset will help researchers understand how proteins form toxic aggregates, which could in turn help them find ways to prevent this from happening. By providing an ‘atlas’ of all possible amyloid beta mutations, the dataset will also help clinicians interpret any new mutations they encounter in patients. By showing whether or not a mutation speeds up aggregation, the atlas will help clinicians predict whether that mutation increases the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.},

              Pharmacogenetics is a prototype of genomics-guided precision medicine. While there is a rapid expansion of novel pharmacogenetic variants discovered by genome sequencing, the lack of variant interpretation in a scalable fashion is a formidable barrier in this field.
              NUDT15
              polymorphism is a major genetic cause for hematopoietic toxicity during thiopurine therapy. Motivated by the need to understand
              NUDT15
              variant effects for clinical actions, we developed a massively parallel assay to preemptively characterize 91.8\% of all possible missense variants in
              NUDT15
              . Our function-based variant classification accurately predicted thiopurine toxicity risk alleles in patients. These results vastly improved the ability to implement genotype-guided thiopurine therapy and illustrated the value and potential of a high-throughput variant effect screen in general.
            
          , 
            
              As a prototype of genomics-guided precision medicine, individualized thiopurine dosing based on pharmacogenetics is a highly effective way to mitigate hematopoietic toxicity of this class of drugs. Recently,
              NUDT15
              deficiency was identified as a genetic cause of thiopurine toxicity, and
              NUDT15
              -informed preemptive dose reduction was quickly adopted in clinical settings. To exhaustively identify pharmacogenetic variants in this gene, we developed massively parallel NUDT15 function assays to determine the variants’ effect on protein abundance and thiopurine cytotoxicity. Of the 3,097 possible missense variants, we characterized the abundance of 2,922 variants and found 54 hotspot residues at which variants resulted in complete loss of protein stability. Analyzing 2,935 variants in the thiopurine cytotoxicity-based assay, we identified 17 additional residues where variants altered NUDT15 activity without affecting protein stability. We identified structural elements key to NUDT15 stability and/or catalytical activity with single amino acid resolution. Functional effects for
              NUDT15
              variants accurately predicted toxicity risk alleles in patients treated with thiopurines with far superior sensitivity and specificity compared to bioinformatic prediction algorithms. In conclusion, our massively parallel variant function assays identified 1,152 deleterious
              NUDT15
              variants, providing a comprehensive reference of variant function and vastly improving the ability to implement pharmacogenetics-guided thiopurine treatment individualization.},

            Glucokinase (GCK) regulates insulin secretion to maintain appropriate blood glucose levels. Sequence variants can alter GCK activity to cause hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HH) or hyperglycemia associated with GCK-maturity-onset diabetes of the young (GCK-MODY), collectively affecting up to 10 million people worldwide. Patients with GCK-MODY are frequently misdiagnosed and treated unnecessarily. Genetic testing can prevent this but is hampered by the challenge of interpreting novel missense variants. Here we exploited a multiplexed yeast complementation assay to measure both hyper- and hypoactive GCK variation, capturing 97\% of all possible missense and nonsense variants. Activity scores correlated with

            catalytic efficiency, fasting glucose levels in carriers of

            variants and with evolutionary conservation. Hypoactive variants were concentrated at buried positions, near the active site, and at a region of known importance for GCK conformational dynamics. Some hyperactive variants shifted the conformational equilibrium towards the active state through a relative destabilization of the inactive conformation. Our comprehensive assessment of GCK variant activity promises to facilitate variant interpretation and diagnosis, expand our mechanistic understanding of hyperactive variants, and inform development of therapeutics targeting GCK.},

The high conservation of Ras requires mechanistic explanation, especially given the general mutational tolerance of proteins. Here, we use deep mutational scanning, biochemical analysis and molecular simulations to understand constraints on Ras sequence. Ras exhibits global sensitivity to mutation when regulated by a GTPase activating protein and a nucleotide exchange factor. Removing the regulators shifts the distribution of mutational effects to be largely neutral, and reveals hotspots of activating mutations in residues that restrain Ras dynamics and promote the inactive state. Evolutionary analysis, combined with structural and mutational data, argue that Ras has co-evolved with its regulators in the vertebrate lineage. Overall, our results show that sequence conservation in Ras depends strongly on the biochemical network in which it operates, providing a framework for understanding the origin of global selection pressures on proteins.},

            The single transmembrane domain (TMD) of the human thrombopoietin receptor (TpoR/myeloproliferative leukemia [MPL] protein), encoded by exon 10 of the MPL gene, is a hotspot for somatic mutations associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Approximately 6\% and 14\% of JAK2 V617F− essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis patients, respectively, have “canonical” MPL exon 10 driver mutations W515L/K/R/A or S505N, which generate constitutively active receptors and consequent loss of Tpo dependence. Other “noncanonical” MPL exon 10 mutations have also been identified in patients, both alone and in combination with canonical mutations, but, in almost all cases, their functional consequences and relevance to disease are unknown. Here, we used a deep mutational scanning approach to evaluate all possible single amino acid substitutions in the human TpoR TMD for their ability to confer cytokine-independent growth in Ba/F3 cells. We identified all currently recognized driver mutations and 7 novel mutations that cause constitutive TpoR activation, and a much larger number of second-site mutations that enhance S505N-driven activation. We found examples of both of these categories in published and previously unpublished MPL exon 10 sequencing data from MPN patients, demonstrating that some, if not all, of the new mutations reported here represent likely drivers or modifiers of myeloproliferative disease.},

              RNA-guided endonucleases (RGENs) have invigorated the field of site-specific nucleases. The success of
              Streptococcus pyogenes
              Cas9 (SpCas9) has led to the discovery of several other CRISPR-associated RGENs. As more RGENs become available, it will be necessary to refine their activity before they can be translated into the clinic. With this in mind, we sought to demonstrate how deep mutational scanning (DMS) could provide details about important functional regions in SpCas9 and speed engineering efforts. Consequently, we developed a nuclease screening platform which could distinguish active Cas9 mutants. We screened a library of 1.9 × 10
              7
              with over 8500 possible non-synonymous mutations and inferred the effects of each mutation using DMS. We demonstrate that the RuvC and HNH domains are the least tolerant regions to mutation. In contrast, the Rec2 and PI domains tolerate mutation better than other regions. The mutation information defined in this work provides a foundation for further SpCas9 engineering. Together, our results demonstrate how DMS can be a powerful tool to uncover features important to RGEN function. Application of this approach to emerging RGENs should enhance their engineering and optimization for therapeutic and other applications.},

	abstract = {The capsids of non-enveloped viruses are highly multimeric and multifunctional protein assemblies that play key roles in viral biology and pathogenesis. Despite their importance, a comprehensive understanding of how mutations affect viral fitness across different structural and functional attributes of the capsid is lacking. To address this limitation, we globally define the effects of mutations across the capsid of a human picornavirus. Using this resource, we identify structural and sequence determinants that accurately predict mutational fitness effects, refine evolutionary analyses, and define the sequence specificity of key capsid-encoded motifs. Furthermore, capitalizing on the derived sequence requirements for capsid-encoded protease cleavage sites, we implement a bioinformatic approach for identifying novel host proteins targeted by viral proteases. Our findings represent the most comprehensive investigation of mutational fitness effects in a picornavirus capsid to date and illuminate important aspects of viral biology, evolution, and host interactions.
          , 
            A virus is made up of genetic material that is encased with a protective protein coat called the capsid. The capsid also helps the virus to infect host cells by binding to the host receptor proteins and releasing its genetic material. Inside the cell, the virus hitchhikes the infected cell’s machinery to grow or replicate its own genetic material.
            Viral capsids are the main target of the host’s defence system, and therefore, continuously change in an attempt to escape the immune system by introducing alterations (known as mutations) into the genes encoding viral capsid proteins. Mutations occur randomly, and so while some changes to the viral capsid might confer an advantage, others may have no effect at all, or even weaken the virus.
            To better understand the effect of capsid mutations on the virus’ ability to infect host cells, Mattenberger et al. studied the Coxsackievirus B3, which is linked to heart problems and acute heart failure in humans. The researchers analysed around 90\% of possible amino acid mutations (over 14,800 mutations) and correlated each mutation to how it influenced the virus’ ability to replicate in human cells grown in the laboratory.
            Based on these results, Mattenberger et al. developed a computer model to predict how a particular mutation might affect the virus. The analysis also identified specific amino acid sequences of capsid proteins that are essential for certain tasks, such as building the capsid. It also included an analysis of sequences in the capsid that allow it to be recognized by another viral protein, which cuts the capsid proteins into the right size from a larger precursor. By looking for similar sequences in human genes, the researchers identified several ones that the virus may attack and inactivate to support its own replication.
            These findings may help identify potential drug targets to develop new antiviral therapies. For example, proteins of the capsid that are less likely to mutate will provide a better target as they lower the possibility of the virus to become resistant to the treatment. They also highlight new proteins in human cells that could potentially block the virus in cells.},

To our knowledge, these are the largest determined comprehensive fitness maps of point mutants. The growth of many variants differed between conditions, indicating that environment can have a large impact on Hsp90 evolution. Multiple variants provided growth advantages under individual conditions; however, these variants tended to exhibit growth defects in other environments. The diversity of Hsp90 sequences observed in extant eukaryotes preferentially contains variants that supported robust growth under all tested conditions. Rather than favoring substitutions in individual conditions, the long-term selective pressure on Hsp90 may have been that of fluctuating environments, leading to robustness under a variety of conditions.},

            As powerful biological catalysts, enzymes can solve challenging problems that range from the industrial production of chemicals to the treatment of human disease. The ability to design new enzymes with tailor-made chemical functions would have a far-reaching impact. However, this important capability has been limited by our cursory understanding of enzyme catalysis. Here, we report a method that uses unbiased empirical analysis to dissect the molecular basis of enzyme function. By comprehensively mapping how changes in an enzyme’s amino acid sequence affect its activity, we obtain a detailed view of the interactions that shape the enzyme function landscape. Large, unbiased analyses of enzyme function allow the discovery of new biochemical mechanisms that will improve our ability to engineer custom biocatalysts.
          , 
            Natural enzymes are incredibly proficient catalysts, but engineering them to have new or improved functions is challenging due to the complexity of how an enzyme’s sequence relates to its biochemical properties. Here, we present an ultrahigh-throughput method for mapping enzyme sequence–function relationships that combines droplet microfluidic screening with next-generation DNA sequencing. We apply our method to map the activity of millions of glycosidase sequence variants. Microfluidic-based deep mutational scanning provides a comprehensive and unbiased view of the enzyme function landscape. The mapping displays expected patterns of mutational tolerance and a strong correspondence to sequence variation within the enzyme family, but also reveals previously unreported sites that are crucial for glycosidase function. We modified the screening protocol to include a high-temperature incubation step, and the resulting thermotolerance landscape allowed the discovery of mutations that enhance enzyme thermostability. Droplet microfluidics provides a general platform for enzyme screening that, when combined with DNA-sequencing technologies, enables high-throughput mapping of enzyme sequence space.},

	abstract = {The structure of fitness landscapes is critical for understanding adaptive protein evolution. Previous empirical studies on fitness landscapes were confined to either the neighborhood around the wild type sequence, involving mostly single and double mutants, or a combinatorially complete subgraph involving only two amino acids at each site. In reality, the dimensionality of protein sequence space is higher (20L) and there may be higher-order interactions among more than two sites. Here we experimentally characterized the fitness landscape of four sites in protein GB1, containing 204 = 160,000 variants. We found that while reciprocal sign epistasis blocked many direct paths of adaptation, such evolutionary traps could be circumvented by indirect paths through genotype space involving gain and subsequent loss of mutations. These indirect paths alleviate the constraint on adaptive protein evolution, suggesting that the heretofore neglected dimensions of sequence space may change our views on how proteins evolve.
          , 
            Proteins can evolve over time by changing their component parts, which are called amino acids. These changes usually happen one at a time and natural selection tends to preserve those changes that make the protein more efficient at its specific tasks, while discarding those that impair the protein’s activity. However the effect of each change depends on the protein as a whole, and so two changes that separately make the protein worse can make it much better if they occur together. This phenomenon is called epistasis and in some cases it can trap proteins in a sub-optimal form and prevent them from improving further.
            Proteins are made from twenty different kinds of amino acid, and there are millions of different combinations of amino acids that could, in theory, make a protein of a given length. Studying protein evolution involves making variants of the same protein, each with just a few changes, and comparing how efficient, or “fit”, they are. Previous studies only measured the fitness of a few variants and showed that epistasis could block protein evolution by requiring the protein to lose some fitness before it could improve further. However, new techniques have now made it easier to study protein evolution by testing many more protein variants.
            Wu, Dai et al. focused on four amino acids in part of a protein called GB1 and tested the efficiency of every possible combination of these four amino acids, a total of 160,000 (204) variants. Contrary to expectations, the results suggested that the protein could evolve quickly to maximise fitness despite there being epistasis between the four amino acids. Overcoming epistasis typically involved making a change to one amino acid that paved the way for further changes while avoiding the need to lose fitness. The original change could then be reversed once the epistasis was overcome. The complexity of this solution means it can only be seen by studying a large number of protein variants that represent many alternative sequences of protein changes.
            Wu, Dai et al. conclude that proteins are able to achieve a higher level of fitness through evolution by exploring a large number of changes. There are many possible changes for each protein and it is this variety that, despite epistasis, allows proteins to become naturally optimised for the tasks that they perform. While the full complexity of protein evolution cannot be explored at the moment, as technology advances it will become possible to study more protein variants. Such advances would therefore hopefully allow researchers to discover even more about the natural mechanisms of protein evolution.},

            Virus-like particles (VLPs) are non-infections viral-derived nanomaterials poised for biotechnological applications due to their well-defined, modular self-assembling architecture. Although progress has been made in understanding the complex effects that mutations may have on VLPs, nuanced understanding of the influence particle mutability has on quaternary structure has yet to be achieved. Here, we generate and compare the apparent fitness landscapes of two capsid geometries (T=3 and T=1 icosahedral) of the bacteriophage MS2 VLP. We find significant shifts in mutability at the symmetry interfaces of the T=1 capsid when compared to the wildtype T=3 assembly. Furthermore, we use the generated landscapes to benchmark the performance of
            in silico
            mutational scanning tools in capturing the effect of missense mutation on complex particle assembly. Finding that predicted stability effects correlated relatively poorly with assembly phenotype, we used a combination of
            de novo
            features in tandem with
            in silico
            results to train machine learning algorithms for the classification of variant effects on assembly. Our findings not only reveal ways that assembly geometry affects the mutable landscape of a self-assembled particle, but also establish a template for the generation of predictive mutational models of self-assembled capsids using minimal empirical training data.},

            We developed a de novo protein design strategy to swiftly engineer decoys for neutralizing pathogens that exploit extracellular host proteins to infect the cell. Our pipeline allowed the design, validation, and optimization of de novo human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) decoys to neutralize severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The best monovalent decoy, CTC-445.2, bound with low nanomolar affinity and high specificity to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) showed that the design is accurate and can simultaneously bind to all three RBDs of a single spike protein. Because the decoy replicates the spike protein target interface in hACE2, it is intrinsically resilient to viral mutational escape. A bivalent decoy, CTC-445.2d, showed {\textasciitilde}10-fold improvement in binding. CTC-445.2d potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells in vitro, and a single intranasal prophylactic dose of decoy protected Syrian hamsters from a subsequent lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge.},

            Deep mutational scanning is a powerful method to explore the mutational fitness landscape of proteins. Its adaptation to anti-CRISPR proteins, which are natural CRISPR-Cas inhibitors and key players in the co-evolution of microbes and phages, would facilitate their in-depth characterization and optimization. Here, we developed a robust anti-CRISPR deep mutational scanning pipeline in
            Escherichia coli
            combining synthetic gene circuits based on CRISPR interference with flow cytometry-coupled sequencing and mathematical modeling. Using this pipeline, we created and characterized comprehensive single point mutation libraries for AcrIIA4 and AcrIIA5, two potent inhibitors of
            Streptococcus pyogenes
            Cas9. The resulting mutational fitness landscapes revealed that both Acrs possess a considerable mutational tolerance as well as an intrinsic redundancy with respect to Cas9 inhibitory features, suggesting evolutionary pressure towards high plasticity and robustness. Finally, to demonstrate that our pipeline can inform the optimization and fine-tuning of Acrs for genome editing applications, we cross-validated a subset of AcrIIA4 mutants via gene editing assays in mammalian cells and
            in vitro
            affinity measurements. Together, our work establishes deep mutational scanning as powerful method for anti-CRISPR protein characterization and optimization.},

              Background
              
                Intracellularly active antimicrobial peptides are promising candidates for the development of antibiotics for human applications. However, drug development using peptides is challenging as, owing to their large size, an enormous sequence space is spanned. We built a high-throughput platform that incorporates rapid investigation of the sequence-activity relationship of peptides and enables rational optimization of their antimicrobial activity. The platform is based on deep mutational scanning of DNA-encoded peptides and employs highly parallelized bacterial self-screening coupled to next-generation sequencing as a readout for their antimicrobial activity. As a target, we used Bac7
                1-23
                , a 23 amino acid residues long variant of bactenecin-7, a potent translational inhibitor and one of the best researched proline-rich antimicrobial peptides.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Using the platform, we simultaneously determined the antimicrobial activity of {\textgreater}600,000 Bac7
                1-23
                variants and explored their sequence-activity relationship. This dataset guided the design of a focused library of {\textasciitilde}160,000 variants and the identification of a lead candidate Bac7PS. Bac7PS showed high activity against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of
                E. coli,
                and its activity was less dependent on SbmA, a transporter commonly used by proline-rich antimicrobial peptides to reach the cytosol and then inhibit translation. Furthermore, Bac7PS displayed strong ribosomal inhibition and low toxicity against eukaryotic cells and demonstrated good efficacy in a murine septicemia model induced by
                E. coli
                .

              classified as pathogenic or benign. Deficiency in human
              5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), the most common
              inherited disorder of folate metabolism, is caused primarily by
              rare missense variants. Further complicating variant
              interpretation, variant impacts often depend on environment. An
              important example of this phenomenon is the MTHFR variant
              p.Ala222Val (c.665C>T), which is carried by half of all humans
              and has a phenotypic impact that depends on dietary folate. Here
              we describe the results of 98,336 variant functional-impact
              assays, covering nearly all possible MTHFR amino acid
              substitutions in four folinate environments, each in the presence
              and absence of p.Ala222Val. The resulting atlas of MTHFR variant
              effects reveals many complex dependencies on both folinate and
              p.Ala222Val. MTHFR atlas scores can distinguish pathogenic from
              benign variants and, among individuals with severe MTHFR
              deficiency, correlate with age of disease onset. Providing a
              powerful tool for understanding structure-function relationships,
              the atlas suggests a role for a disordered loop in retaining
              cofactor at the active site and identifies variants that enable
              escape of inhibition by S-adenosylmethionine. Thus, a model based

              a set of rare, autosomal recessive diseases known as serine
              biosynthesis defects. Serine biosynthesis defects present in a
              broad phenotypic spectrum that includes, at the severe end,
              Neu-Laxova syndrome, a lethal multiple congenital anomaly
              disease, intermediately in the form of infantile serine
              biosynthesis defects with severe neurological manifestations and
              growth deficiency, and at the mild end, as childhood disease with
              intellectual disability. However, because L-serine
              supplementation, especially if started early, can ameliorate and
              in some cases even prevent symptoms, knowledge of pathogenic
              variants is highly actionable. METHODS: Recently, our laboratory
              established a yeast-based assay for human PSAT1 function. We have
              now applied it at scale to assay the functional impact of 1,914
              SNV-accessible amino acid substitutions. In addition to assaying
              the functional impact of individual variants in yeast haploid
              cells, we can assay pairwise combinations of PSAT1 alleles that
              recapitulate human genotypes, including compound heterozygotes,
              in yeast diploids. RESULTS: Results of our assays of individual
              variants (in haploid yeast cells) agree well with clinical
              interpretations and protein structure-function relationships,
              supporting the use of our data as functional evidence under the
              ACMG interpretation guidelines. Results from our diploid assay
              successfully distinguish patient genotypes from those of healthy
              carriers and agree well with disease severity. Finally, we
              present a linear model that uses individual allele measurements
              (in haploid yeast cells) to accurately predict the biallelic
              function (in diploid yeast cells) of ~ 1.8 million allele
              combinations corresponding to potential human genotypes.
              CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our work provides an example of how
              large-scale functional assays in model systems can be powerfully
              applied to the study of a rare disease.",

              inhibitor contact residues, residues that participate in

              few have actually been successfully targeted and many are
              considered `undruggable'. This is particularly true for proteins
              that function via protein-protein interactions: direct inhibition
              of binding interfaces is difficult, requiring the identification
              of allosteric sites. However, most proteins have no known
              allosteric sites and a comprehensive allosteric map does not
              exist for any protein. Here we address this shortcoming by
              charting multiple global atlases of inhibitory allosteric
              communication in KRAS, a protein mutated in 1 in 10 human
              cancers. We quantified the impact of >26,000 mutations on the

              activation of numerous protein substrates referred to as clients.
              While the molecular determinants of Hsp90 client specificity are
              poorly understood and limited to a handful of client proteins,
              strong clients are thought to be destabilized and
              conformationally extended. Here, we measured the
              phosphotransferase activity of 3929 variants of the tyrosine
              kinase Src in both the presence and absence of an Hsp90
              inhibitor. We identified 84 previously unknown functionally
              dependent client variants. Unexpectedly, many destabilized or
              extended variants were not functionally dependent on Hsp90.
              Instead, functionally dependent client variants were clustered in
              the $\alpha$F pocket and $\beta$1-$\beta$2 strand regions of Src,
              which have yet to be described in driving Hsp90 dependence. Hsp90
              dependence was also strongly correlated with kinase activity. We
              found that a combination of activation, global extension, and
              general conformational flexibility, primarily induced by variants
              at the $\alpha$F pocket and $\beta$1-$\beta$2 strands, was
              necessary to render Src functionally dependent on Hsp90.
              Moreover, the degree of activation and flexibility required to
              transform Src into a functionally dependent client varied with
              variant location, suggesting that a combination of regulatory
              domain disengagement and catalytic domain flexibility are
              required for chaperone dependence. Thus, by studying the
              chaperone dependence of a massive number of variants, we
              highlight factors driving Hsp90 client specificity and propose a
              model of chaperone-kinase interactions.",

              importance, our present understanding of this essential viral
              protein is limited. The roles of a small subset of specific amino
              acids have been reported, but a more comprehensive understanding
              of the relationship between M1 sequence, structure, and virus
              fitness remains elusive. In this study, we used deep mutational
              scanning to measure the effect of every amino acid substitution
              in M1 on viral replication in cell culture. The map of amino acid
              mutational tolerance we have generated allows us to identify
              sites that are functionally constrained in cell culture as well
              as sites that are less constrained. Several sites that exhibit
              low tolerance to mutation have been found to be critical for M1
              function and production of viable virions. Surprisingly,
              significant portions of the M1 sequence, especially in the
              C-terminal domain, whose structure is undetermined, were found to
              be highly tolerant of amino acid variation, despite having
              extremely low levels of sequence diversity among natural
              influenza virus strains. This unexpected discrepancy indicates
              that not all sites in M1 that exhibit high sequence conservation
              in nature are under strong constraint during selection for viral
              replication in cell culture.IMPORTANCE The M1 matrix protein is
              critical for many stages of the influenza virus infection cycle.
              Currently, we have an incomplete understanding of this highly
              conserved protein's function and structure. Key regions of M1,
              particularly in the C terminus of the protein, remain poorly
              characterized. In this study, we used deep mutational scanning to
              determine the extent of M1's tolerance to mutation. Surprisingly,
              nearly two-thirds of the M1 sequence exhibits a high tolerance
              for substitutions, contrary to the extremely low sequence
              diversity observed across naturally occurring M1 isolates. Sites
              with low mutational tolerance were also identified, suggesting
              that they likely play critical functional roles and are under
              selective pressure. These results reveal the intrinsic mutational

              receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 have been extensively studied due to
              their roles in white blood cell development and inflammation and
              their status as coreceptors for HIV-1 infection, among other

              function/s of self-associations are unclear. While CXCR4 has been
              crystallized in a dimeric arrangement, available atomic
              resolution structures of CCR5 are monomeric. To investigate the
              dimerization interfaces of these chemokine receptors, we used a

              deep mutational scanning to find mutations that modify receptor

              this dimeric arrangement in living cells. A mutationally
              intolerant region was also observed on the surface of CCR5 by
              transmembrane helices 3 and 4. Mutations from the deep mutational

              these issues, we selected the ubiquitin-protein ligase Parkin,

              abundance of Parkin missense variants in cultured human cells.
              The resulting mutational map, covering 9219 out of the 9300
              possible single-site amino acid substitutions and nonsense Parkin
              variants, show that most low abundance variants are located
              within the structured domains of the protein, while the flexible
              linker regions are more tolerant. The vast majority of low
              abundance Parkin variants are degraded through the
              ubiquitin-proteasome system and are stabilized at a lowered
              temperature. The cellular abundance data correlate with
              thermodynamic stability, evolutionary conservation, and show that
              half of the known disease-linked variants are found at low
              abundance. Systematic mapping of degradation signals (degrons)
              shows that inherent primary degrons in Parkin largely overlap
              with regions that are buried, and highly sensitive to mutations.

              either via destabilization of the native protein, or by
              introducing local signals for degradation. Combined with the
              computational methods based on Parkin structure and conservation,
              our abundance map sheds light on the mechanisms that cause loss

              Although sequencing-based diagnosis can be definitive, ~⅓ of
              clinical HMBS variants are missense variants, and most
              clinically-reported HMBS missense variants are designated as
              ``variants of uncertain significance'' (VUS). Using saturation
              mutagenesis, en masse selection, and sequencing, we applied a
              multiplexed validated assay to both the erythroid-specific and

              impact scores for >84\% of all possible amino-acid substitutions.
              The resulting variant effect maps generally agreed with

              suggested residue roles in active site dynamics that were
              supported by molecular dynamics simulations. Most importantly,
              these HMBS variant effect maps can help discriminate pathogenic

  abstract = "How protein properties such as protein activity and protein
              essentiality affect the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of
              mutations are important questions in protein evolution. Deep
              mutational scanning studies typically measure the effects of a
              comprehensive set of mutations on either protein activity or
              fitness. Our understanding of the underpinnings of the DFE would
              be enhanced by a comprehensive study of both for the same gene.
              Here, we compared the fitness effects and in vivo protein
              activity effects of ∼4,500 missense mutations in the E. coli rnc
              gene. This gene encodes RNase III, a global regulator enzyme that
              cleaves diverse RNA substrates including precursor ribosomal RNA
              and various mRNAs including its own 5' untranslated region
              (5'UTR). We find that RNase III's ability to cleave dsRNA is the
              most important determinant of the fitness effects of rnc
              mutations. The DFE of RNase III was bimodal, with mutations
              centered around neutral and deleterious effects, consistent with
              previously reported DFE's of enzymes with a singular
              physiological role. Fitness was buffered to small effects on
              RNase III activity. The enzyme's RNase III domain, which contains
              the RNase III signature motif and all active site residues, was
              more sensitive to mutation than its dsRNA binding domain, which
              is responsible for recognition and binding to dsRNA. Differential
              effects on fitness and functional scores for mutations at highly
              conserved residues G97, G99, and F188 suggest that these

              insufficient evidence of clinical consequences and thus limited
              clinical utility. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate the power of
              variant effect mapping, which couples saturation mutagenesis with
              high-throughput sequencing, to ascertain the function of
              thousands of protein coding KCNE1 variants. We comprehensively
              assayed KCNE1 variant cell surface expression (2,554/2,709
              possible single amino acid variants) and function (2,539
              variants). We identified 470 loss-of-surface expression and 588
              loss-of-function variants. Out of the 588 loss-of-function
              variants, only 155 had low cell surface expression. The latter
              half of the protein is dispensable for protein trafficking but
              essential for channel function. 22 of the 30 KCNE1 residues
              (73\%) highly intolerant of variation were in predicted close
              contact with binding partners KCNQ1 or calmodulin. Our data were
              highly concordant with gold standard electrophysiological data

              concordant variants), and computational metrics ($\rho$ = -0.55).
              Our data provide moderate-strength evidence for the ACMG/AMP

              Polymorphisms within these drug transporters result in
              inter-individual variation in drug response, with some patients
              not responding to the recommended dosage of drug whereas others
              experience catastrophic side effects. For example, variants
              within the major hepatic Human organic cation transporter OCT1
              (SLC22A1) can change endogenous organic cations and many
              prescription drug levels. To understand how variants
              mechanistically impact drug uptake, we systematically study how
              all known and possible single missense and single amino acid
              deletion variants impact expression and substrate uptake of OCT1.
              We find that human variants primarily disrupt function via
              folding rather than substrate uptake. Our study revealed that the
              major determinants of folding reside in the first 300 amino
              acids, including the first 6 transmembrane domains and the
              extracellular domain (ECD) with a stabilizing and highly
              conserved stabilizing helical motif making key interactions
              between the ECD and transmembrane domains. Using the functional
              data combined with computational approaches, we determine and
              validate a structure-function model of OCT1s conformational
              ensemble without experimental structures. Using this model and
              molecular dynamic simulations of key mutants, we determine
              biophysical mechanisms for how specific human variants alter
              transport phenotypes. We identify differences in frequencies of
              reduced function alleles across populations with East Asians vs
              European populations having the lowest and highest frequency of
              reduced function variants, respectively. Mining human population
              databases reveals that reduced function alleles of OCT1
              identified in this study associate significantly with high LDL
              cholesterol levels. Our general approach broadly applied could
              transform the landscape of precision medicine by producing a
              mechanistic basis for understanding the effects of human

Using saturation codon-mutagenesis, en masse growth selection, and sequencing, we generated a comprehensive, proactive map of CBS missense variant function.

              For severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to enter human cells, the spike protein on the surface of the virus must bind to the host receptor protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A soluble version of the receptor is being explored as a therapeutic. Chan
              et al.
              used deep mutagenesis to identify ACE2 mutants that bind more tightly to the spike protein and combined mutations to further increase binding affinity (see the Perspective by DeKosky). A promising variant was engineered to be a stable dimer that has a binding affinity for the spike protein; it is comparable with neutralizing antibodies and neutralized both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 in a cell-based assay. In addition, the similarity to the natural receptor may limit the possibility for viral escape.

            A variant of ACE2 based on deep mutagenesis far outcompetes the natural receptor in binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
          , 
            The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells to initiate entry, and soluble ACE2 is a therapeutic candidate that neutralizes infection by acting as a decoy. By using deep mutagenesis, mutations in ACE2 that increase S binding are found across the interaction surface, in the asparagine 90–glycosylation motif and at buried sites. The mutational landscape provides a blueprint for understanding the specificity of the interaction between ACE2 and S and for engineering high-affinity decoy receptors. Combining mutations gives ACE2 variants with affinities that rival those of monoclonal antibodies. A stable dimeric variant shows potent SARS-CoV-2 and -1 neutralization in vitro. The engineered receptor is catalytically active, and its close similarity with the native receptor may limit the potential for viral escape.},

            Next generation sequencing has become a common tool in the diagnosis of genetic diseases. However, for the vast majority of genetic variants that are discovered, a clinical interpretation is not available. Variant effect mapping allows the functional effects of many single amino acid variants to be characterized in parallel. Here, we combine multiplexed functional assays with machine learning to assess the effects of amino acid substitutions in the human intellectual disability-associated gene,
            GDI1

            GDI1

	abstract = {Insertion of helix-forming segments into the membrane and their association determines the structure, function, and expression levels of all plasma membrane proteins. However, systematic and reliable quantification of membrane-protein energetics has been challenging. We developed a deep mutational scanning method to monitor the effects of hundreds of point mutations on helix insertion and self-association within the bacterial inner membrane. The assay quantifies insertion energetics for all natural amino acids at 27 positions across the membrane, revealing that the hydrophobicity of biological membranes is significantly higher than appreciated. We further quantitate the contributions to membrane-protein insertion from positively charged residues at the cytoplasm-membrane interface and reveal large and unanticipated differences among these residues. Finally, we derive comprehensive mutational landscapes in the membrane domains of Glycophorin A and the ErbB2 oncogene, and find that insertion and self-association are strongly coupled in receptor homodimers.
          , 
            Cells are defined by a thin membrane that separates the inside of the cell from the outside. The core of this membrane is hydrophobic, meaning that it repels water. Many signals and nutrients cannot pass through the membrane itself, but can pass through the proteins that span the membrane. Membrane proteins are therefore essential for living cells; yet even after decades of research, it remains unclear how proteins interact with the membrane and which features determine a protein’s stability in a biological membrane.
            Since the early 1980s it was known that the bacterium E. coli could grow on a common antibiotic called ampicillin if it had enough of an antibiotic-degrading enzyme called β-lactamase anchored into its inner membrane. Now, Elazar et al. have used this enzyme to obtain detailed information on the interactions between a biological membrane and a membrane protein. First, hundreds of different mutations were introduced into the gene that encodes the enzyme to generate a population of bacteria that each had a slightly different membrane anchor. The mutant bacteria were then grown in the presence of the antibiotic, meaning that those mutants with a more stable membrane anchor were more likely to survive and grow than those with less stable anchors.
            Elazar et al. then collected all the surviving bacteria, sequenced their DNA and measured how common the different mutations were in the final population. This approach was less labor-intensive and more accurate than traditional methods for monitoring membrane-anchored proteins, and the resulting large dataset was used to uncover which features affect a protein’s stability in a membrane. These results also showed that a biological membrane’s core is considerably more hydrophobic than was previously thought.
            In addition to being hydrophobic, biological membranes have more negative charge in the side that faces into the cell. This means that membrane proteins with a positive charge in this region will be more stable, and Elazar et al. were able to use their new system to measure this effect for the first time.
            Finally, membrane proteins do not only span the membrane; they also bind with other membrane proteins in order to carry out their roles. Elazar et al. used their system to look at the surfaces of human membrane proteins that interact with one another, and build a detailed map of the interaction surfaces, from which they derived accurate models of the membrane proteins.
            Overall, these new findings could now be used to model the three-dimensional structures of membrane proteins and improve their stability. This in turn may help efforts to develop these proteins into more robust experimental tools and in the search for drugs that target membrane proteins.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          The influenza virus polymerase is central to influenza virus evolution. Adaptive mutations within the polymerase are often a prerequisite for efficient spread of novel animal-derived viruses in human populations. The polymerase also determines fidelity, and therefore the rate at which the virus will acquire mutations that lead to host range expansion, drug resistance, or antigenic drift. Despite its importance to viral replication and evolution, our understanding of the mutational effects and associated constraints on the influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is relatively limited. We performed deep mutational scanning of the A/WSN/1933(H1N1) PB1, generating a library of 95.4\% of amino acid substitutions at 757 sites. After accuracy filters, we were able to measure replicative fitness for 13,354 (84\%) of all possible amino acid substitutions, and 16 were validated by results from pairwise competition assays. Functional and structural constraints were better revealed by individual sites involved in RNA or protein interactions than by major subdomains defined by sequence conservation. Mutational tolerance, as defined by site entropy, was correlated with evolutionary potential, as captured by diversity in available H1N1 sequences. Of 29 beneficial sites, many have either been identified in the natural evolution of PB1 or shown experimentally to have important impacts on replication and adaptation. Accessibility of amino acid substitutions by single nucleotide mutation was a key factor in determining whether mutations appeared in natural PB1 evolution. Our work provides a comprehensive map of mutational effects on a viral RdRp and a valuable resource for subsequent studies of influenza replication and evolution.},

          MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) responsible for initiating signaling pathways involved in development and wound repair. MET activation relies on ligand binding to the extracellular receptor, which prompts dimerization, intracellular phosphorylation, and recruitment of associated signaling proteins. Mutations, which are predominantly observed clinically in the intracellular juxtamembrane and kinase domains, can disrupt typical MET regulatory mechanisms. Understanding how juxtamembrane variants, such as exon 14 skipping (METΔEx14), and rare kinase domain mutations can increase signaling, often leading to cancer, remains a challenge. Here, we perform a parallel deep mutational scan (DMS) of MET intracellular kinase domain in two fusion protein backgrounds: wild type and METΔEx14. Our comparative approach has revealed a critical hydrophobic interaction between a juxtamembrane segment and the kinase ⍺C helix, pointing to differences in regulatory mechanisms between MET and other RTKs. Additionally, we have uncovered a β5 motif that acts as a structural pivot for kinase domain activation in MET and other TAM family of kinases. We also describe a number of previously unknown activating mutations, aiding the effort to annotate driver, passenger, and drug resistance mutations in the MET kinase domain.},

              PPM1D
              encodes a serine/threonine phosphatase that regulates numerous pathways including the DNA damage response and p53. Activating mutations and amplification of
              PPM1D
              are found across numerous cancer types. GSK2830371 is a potent and selective allosteric inhibitor of PPM1D, but its mechanism of binding and inhibition of catalytic activity are unknown. Here we use computational, biochemical and functional genetic studies to elucidate the molecular basis of GSK2830371 activity. These data confirm that GSK2830371 binds an allosteric site of PPM1D with high affinity. By further incorporating data from hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation, we demonstrate that PPM1D exists in an equilibrium between two conformations that are defined by the movement of the flap domain, which is required for substrate recognition. A hinge region was identified that is critical for switching between the two conformations and was directly implicated in the high-affinity binding of GSK2830371 to PPM1D. We propose that the two conformations represent active and inactive forms of the protein reflected by the position of the flap, and that binding of GSK2830371 shifts the equilibrium to the inactive form. Finally, we found that C-terminal truncating mutations proximal to residue 400 result in destabilization of the protein via loss of a stabilizing N- and C-terminal interaction, consistent with the observation from human genetic data that nearly all
              PPM1D
              mutations in cancer are truncating and occur distal to residue 400. Taken together, our findings elucidate the mechanism by which binding of a small molecule to an allosteric site of PPM1D inhibits its activity and provides insights into the biology of PPM1D.},

A major risk factor of CHD is high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which is the defining feature of familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic disorder characterized by mutations in genes involved in cholesterol uptake, such as LDLRAP1. The risk of CHD can be reduced by LDL-C-lowering medications called statins that potently inhibit HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction of the mevalonate pathway. The study of genetic variation in CHD-related genes may contribute to early detection or prevention of CHD. I exhaustively mapped missense variant effects of two CHD-related genes, HMGCR and LDLRAP1. Proactive maps of human HMGCR may be able to model patient response to statins and identify the statin with the greatest likelihood of efficacy. Proactive maps of LDLRAP1 may identify pathogenic variation of autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH) for early diagnosis of ARH.},
