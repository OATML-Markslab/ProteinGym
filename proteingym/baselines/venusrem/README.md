# Retrieval-Enhanced Mutation Mastery: Augmenting Zero-Shot Prediction of Protein Language Model

## ðŸ›« Requirement

### Conda Enviroment
```
conda env create -f venusrem_environment.yml
conda activate venusrem
```

### Downloads

To score the ProteinGym DMS substitution assays with VenusREM, you will need to download the following files:
- aa_seq and struc_seq files may be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lSckfPlx7FhzK1FX7EtmmXUOrdiMRerY/view?usp=sharing
- sequence alignments may be downloaded from the standard ProteinGym portal:
```
curl -o DMS_msa_files.zip https://marks.hms.harvard.edu/proteingym/ProteinGym_v1.1/DMS_msa_files.zip
```

### Hardware

- For inference, the venusREM team recommends at least 10G of graphics memory, such as RTX 3080

## ðŸ§¬ Zero-shot Prediction for Mutants on ProteinGym

### Evaluation on ProteinGym

Refer to the scoring_VenusREM_substitutions.sh script under `scripts/scoring_DMS_zero_shot`.
